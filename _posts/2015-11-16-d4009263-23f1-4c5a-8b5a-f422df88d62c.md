"Hello!  My name is Harley Cutler.  I am a German Pointer and Australian Shepard - I think.  My parents and I aren't exactly sure what else I could be.  I was a stray in New Mexico, rescued in Colorado, and now I live in Vermont! I am happy as can be!  Sticks and tennis balls are my favorite things...and food! These are my adventures and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!" :)
